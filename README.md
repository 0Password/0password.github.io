# 0Password

The ultimate password manager that doesn't mess around. It keeps your digital life locked down tighter than Fort Knox, all while remembering absolutely nothing.

## How It Works

1. **0Password** - This is your master key. Keep it safe.
2. **Service** - Where's this password going? Reddit? X? You name it.
3. **Customize** - Choose if you want digits, etc. It's all about that custom touch.
4. **Retrieve** - Hit that button and watch the magic happen. Voilà, your password ready to roll.

## Features
